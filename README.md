The purpose of this project is to have a simple way of monitoring the Freifunk Ulm Network.

Therefore, this tool contains two parts:
1. shell based script that connects to the vpn-nodes and determines the status to dump in into a json file
2. html file that reads the json file and displays it using javascript and css
